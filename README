jZonu - A Java re-write of the Zonu BBS Browser

To find the original Zonu, look here: https://github.com/zonu/zonu

Shoutout to sabitsuki and meltingwax for making the awesome BBS browser! (Or, at least, you guys did like 90% of the work)

If you need more information about this, feel free to contact me. To get an idea of what it is/how it works, either look at the code, or read the original Zonu readme.

Enjoy!
